# U-Escape

## Summary:

This is an Escape The Room game developed by Nadim and designed by Abby, Tyler and Ami. The concept of the game is to model a house that is based on the type of personality that each member of the team has. Each room has a certain puzzle or action the user has to do in order to unlock the door.


## External Sources:

We used some external libraries to help us build the game:
- VRTK 3.3.0 
- Oculus Utilities


## Division of labor:

Abby, Ami Tyler:
  - Designed Houses in Maya
  - Designed 3D Objects in Maya
  - Added a terrain and skybox
  
Nadim:
  - Create code to make objects interactive
  - Find the correct compatible libraries to work with 
  - Testing and Development
 
 
 ## Outcome:
 
 The project is functional and can run on an Oculus, Emulator or the other supported platforms provided by VRTK. The main idea of the game is to create a task so that the uer can perform which will lead to the doors opening. One of the houses require you to place the tables in a certain position so that the door would unlock. Another houses requires the player to place the same amount of rocks on the scale in order to unlock the house. the third houses requires the player to find the correct gun out of relpicas and when they do, it will unlock the door.
 
 Our vision for the project was more ambitios than what we expected, keeping in mind the timeframe and resource restrictions. Animations, more puzzle tasks, hints and tips, HUD and timers are some of the aspects that need to be worked on further more in order for the project to align with our initial vision. 
 
 ## Manual:
 
 The game is designed to be a free ranging experience which allows the players to explore. Movement is done through the joysticks with the addded feature of teleportation upon pressing the joystick. All items that can be picked up and used will be highlighted when the hand is in contact with the object.


## Issues:

There are some known issues with using unity projects and github. Upon cloning this repository, an error will pop out in the unity editor indicating that some scripts are missing even though they aren't in the actual repo.
